# Project Akawo
Akawo is a decentralized Bank. Here user deposit tokens of choice(usdt,BTC,ETH, MATIC), use any of it to buy 
AKW token, because holding AKW is neccessary to utilize the platform.

# Functionality
-Users save usdt, BTC, ETH, MATIC or AKW tokens.
-Users earn by showing activeness on the platform every 24hours by clicking on 'Earn'.
-User choose to use fixed or flexible savings. Fixed savings locks up the user tokens for sometime but flexible can be
withdrawn at will
-There is withdrawal fee which are paid by users when trying to withdraw from a flexible savings account, but no
if it is a fixed account. The withdrawal fee is 0.1% of value of tokens (in usdt) been withdrawn. This fee is paid 
using AKW.
-The fee from withdrawals are used to buy back AKW tokens every quarter.
-The earning is not same for fixed or flexible saving. Fixed savings users earns twice as much as flexible.
